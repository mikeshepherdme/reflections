When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Making a remote repository allows you to push or pull from other computers or share work 
with collaborators. Otherwise, you or collaborators would always have to use the same machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

You wouldn't want Git to make these types of automatic changes while making a change because 
that particular iteration may destablize the solid base code of a project. The manual commit
should come once all logical changes are made.
